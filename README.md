Programs in order to learn python


These are programs that I used to learn python. Some/most of these
programs are mathematical simulations that I had an interest into
converting into code.

Birthday Problem:
  The birthday problem is a statistical phenomenon that is taught in most
  college statistics classes. The phenomenon is that in a group of
  people there is a very high chance that people share a birthday.

  There are two sides to simulating this situation: the size of the group
  and what their birthdays are. So I first asked for the group size 
  and then assigned them a birthday. You add up every simulation where
  two people have the same birthday.

  According to the formula, there is about a 50% chance that two people 
  will share a birthay in a group of 23 people.

Books:
  The books code is a mathematical simulation where a student has to
  retake a class the following year and I check that out of how many
  simulations does the student get the same textbook that he had the 
  previous year.

  Another interpretation is that students are given textbooks at the start
  of the year. But just after they recieve the books they are taken back
  so that they may be entered into the system. What are the chances that
  a student will get the same textbook that he got in the first place.

PrimeNumbers:
  This is not a simulation but rather code to find the nth prime number.
  The user enters which prime number he wants and the code finds it.

  The brute force method is simple, but I have tried to make my code 
  as efficient as possible by using the current knowledge that I have.

  I create an array of prime numbers that start with the first four
  prime numbers. Then I check every odd number after them and if it not
  divisible by an existing prime number in the array then the number
  is a prime number.

  I also only check up to the square root of the number (that I am trying
  to check if is a prime or not). This is because there will not be a 
  breakdown of the number being checked without a prime number that is 
  less than its square root.
